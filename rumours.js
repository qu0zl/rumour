"Young children are going missing in the poorer parts of town; thieves' quarter, Turlin's Well and the Outer Quarter. Undersheriff Kotchko(K5) is desperate to stop it and he'll pay for information.",
"Strange bandit attacks have plagued Tent City these past few weeks. Thick fog rolls in from the fields east of town, and screaming and death follows fast behind. Travellers and possessions have disappeared in the attacks. It's the gods punishing us for letting any scum who wish camp near our city, no offence meant to y'all.",
"The dead don't sleep proper at night in the City of Ashes. Only a fool goes up there after dark.",
"Hand of Fate? Pah! Looks more like the foul claw of some hideous beast to me.",
"There ain't no toll to use the Stoneheart bridge t'north of da city. If you look proper, The Free Defenders won't bother ya much, but if they take a dislike to yah, then they'll get real intimate.",
"The Citadel of the Griffins is our first line of defence. The Lyreguard did us proud when the Hunn invaded those years past. 30 miles is too far for these old bones, or I'd head north and thank the Lyreguard myself.",
"I heard that King Ovar's gonna return from the deserts of Irkaina soon, riding his Black Dragon, and leading the victorious Foerdewaith army! That's gonna be some sight; I hope my boys make it back with him, they went to slaughter those Huun filth.",
"It's been 2 years since anyone's heard word of the army pursuing the Huun. May'hap they all vanished like the Army of Light. It's Orcus' work, I'll wager.",
"14 months of siege sure makes you enjoy the quiet times. Even if it's been 2 years now.",
"Sometimes you'll get away carrying weapons in the outer quarters, but try that near the keep, or anywhere sa-loo-bri-us and you'll see how much patience the guards have.",
"There ain't much love lost between the Sheriffs and the Constables. The 'Brownies' don't get paid as well as those fancy Sheriffs. I guess walking the beat and solving crime ain't as imporant as serving warrants and holding prisoners. High Sheriff Topfer Brighteye's a good'un though, can't argue 'bout that.",
"Seems a bit daft that the head of each guild gets the same vote in the Council of Burghers. Wheelwrights must must be ten times the size of the Alchemists' Guild, but Duloth Armitage still only gets a single vote. Don't seem quite right to me.",
"The Wizard's Guilds' lead by the Dominion Arcance. The Dominion's supposed to be secret but the naivest country bumpkin knows that Velior, Andrigor and Manisool are part of it. You knew that, right?",
"Even the lowliest Magic User is welcome to join the Wizard's Guild. I hear they trade knowledge better left unknown. No good ever came of magic users, that's what my Pappy always said, and he should know, he married one.",
"Something horrific happened to the old thieves' guild, 'The Grey Deacons' a decade past. They completely disappeared overnight. I'd wager they got on the wrong side of Duloth.",
"The wheelwrights 'av got thousands of men, and thousands of cudgels. They can even bring trade to a stand-still. Sometimes I think they're the real power in this city.",
"If you upset the wrong person, you might just meet an assassin from the Red Blades in a dark alleyway.",
"The thieves, the vampires, and the cart makers are all in league. In league, I tells yah!",
"High Guardian Elissa Perinor is always looking for more recruits for the Order of Protectors of Vanitthu. You'll often see their battle clerics riding along with the Free Defenders, or the Lyre Guard. Bard's Gate is lucky to have them.",
"Why would anyone worship Thyr or Muir? They lost their burial halls, heck, they lost the entire Valley of Shrines! Bofred and Barahill may want a crusade to get them back, but you'd be a fool to put your faith in gods that can't even protect their own shrines!",
"Bofred the Just!, Barahill the Faithfull! Mark those names, the High Priests of Thyr and of Muir! They'll lead the crusade to take back the Valley of Shrines. Them and their Order of the Sword of Retribution. If it wasn't for me gammy knee, I'd sign-up myself. You should sign-up. Do some good in this world, I always say.",
"You heard of the Longhunters? Not many have. Great rangers, they help keep the wilderness around the city safe. You won't see them inside the city, too many people for their liking. Sometimes they'll be over in Fort Rendezvous in Tent City. I think the wildness there is more to their liking. Me, I prefer silk sheets and warm beds.",
"I heard some damn fool Dwarves, in the Outer District, singing tales of their Lost Kingdom. Over in the Stoneheart mountains somewhere. They even tried to recruit some nearby Dwarves to venture up onto the Ice Plateau. Hah! They'll find it hard to sing when they're frozen into icicles.",
"I don't know why everyone thinks the Huun all fled. Makes sense to me that some of them could still be out there, hiding in the forests like the stinking brigands that they are.",
"Hot summer days can be hard. Great black swarms of insects come up from Stoneheart forest and drive both man and mule mad. The only thing they won't bite is those poor plagued beggars who stumble 'round outside the city walls.",
"I heard there's a knight and his retinue riding out from the old Tradeway abbey of Vannithu. He ain't much of a 'Vigilant Guard' though, I heard he robbed a mechant, stripped him down to his undergarments, and left him to walk back to the city. I wonder what Vannithu thinks of that!",
"Some bizarre flying three-headed creature attacked a group of adventurers near the Valley of Shrines. The survivor said that one head was like a Dragon's, one was like a Lion's, and one was some kind of demented sheep. You know the strangest thing? That guy had no eyebrows left - they were all singed and burnt off! Weirdest thing I ever did see; he looked perpetually surprised, if you know what I mean.",
"There's an old Black Dragon done set up lair in the Gem mines near the Valley of Shrines. The city was just about to drive him out when the Huun attacked. I'm sure the Burghers haven't forgotten about all those gems though. That Dragon's days round here are numbered.",
"There's Orcs in the hills to the west. How do I know? I bought a Longhunter a drink over in Tent City.",
"The Silverhelm Dwarves shut the doors of their Halls to everyone maybe half a decade ago. They used to be such good friends to the city. I wonder why they did that?",
"A few tired, desperate looking souls, came into town last night. Said they were the only survivors of the village of Taverlan and claiming that their village was attacked by dozens of monsters. Monsters like people but with strange dog heads!<br>I dunno, maybe they were just hoping to losen my purse strings with their crazy tales, but I do think someone should check on the village. It's 3 days to the north, near the west shore of the Stoneheart river.",
"Lisetha, a singer at the Inn of the Six Candles, is of noble birth! Pieter, her father, disowned her when she became pregnant and she refuses to say who the child's father is. Piter suspects half the young nobles of the city and he'll die in one of his ridiculous duels with them soon, no doubt.",
"I'm sure that someone would pay good coin for some eggs from the Citadel of Griffons. I don't think the Lyreguard would take that kindly though!",
"You ever seen Griffon riders in flight? You'll see them soar over the city patrolling sometimes. I saw one land on the Keep just yesterday. Probably bringing a message from one of the Citadels, I suppose.",
"They've done a good job rebuilding the Citadel of Ravens after the Huun razed it. The Huun couldn't ignore a Citadel so near to the city. I still remember the smell of the burning bodies of its defenders, the alive and the dead, stacked up outside the city walls in a great funeral pyre. The Huun couldn't break our spirits then, or ever.",
"You can trust a Gatesman. They pay them well, and move them between gates often enough that they can't get up to much badness even if they wanted to. Plus, they brand the odd enterprising one who still goes bad. Who wants to go through life branded? Not me!",
"My sister-in-law's a Wall Watcher. Proper name for them that. They might as well be watching walls for all the excitement they see. Imagine spending the whole night just staring at the city from the wall, and they're the lucky ones. Their poor partner has to stare out instead! I bet they're the only ones who hope that the Huun come back soon so they've something interesting to look at!",
"If you want information then go seek the Beggars in the Canal district. I'd swear some of them know everything that goes on in this city!",
    "The Shadow Masks are such expert spies that you don't go to them when you need to hire a spy, they find out and they come to you!",
    "The Maiden's Cross Tavern in Turlin's Well is an odd one. Jenette, the owner, only hires women to work there, and I saw her arguing in the street with Bofred the High Priest of Thyr. She gave as good as she got, I'd have thought she was a Paladin herself if I didn't know better.",
    "'av you 'eard 'bout ta Saints o' Turlin's Well? Vigilantes, ye know? Crackin skulls and righten wrongs. Best ting t'happen to the Well in memory, I say. T'authorities don't care 'bout us little folk.",
    "The Dog Soldiers are what passes for law and order over in Tent City. Don't bet on them being around when you need 'em, and if they are, they may just string up whoever their idea of frontier justice says is in the wrong.",
    "I wouldn't hang out 'round the Docks, the Canals or the Thieves Quarter after dark. Actually, I wouldn't hang out in those places during the day much either!",
    "While few notice beggars, the beggars themselves notice much,",
    "The Scribes Guild knows everybody's business by necessity, but they won't talk. More trustworthy than a priest of Thyr that lot are.",
    "The Gem Cutter and Jewelers Guild is where I'd start looking for work. Especially if I wanted to rob my employer!",
    "Oghma is the most widely worshipped faith in the city. When High Harpist Jared Strahn speaks, everyone listens. Everyone with sense anyway.",
    "Bard's College is the intellectual core of the city. Bards, Magic Users, Poets, Artists, all that is elevates us above the beasts.",
    "Maestro Lauriann Danyr is more than just the chancellor of Bard's College. She's a clever politician too. Sharp, and wise, but she ain't nasty. The College is lucky to have her.",
    "It's sad what happened to Brelliar the Conjurer. He was a sharp as a tack, a great wizard and one of the good ones , you know. Then overnight he was as forgetful and confused as my poor old grand-pa in his final years. It's scary to think that dementia can come on as suddenly as that, I'd never thought it possible before. Maybe he dabbled with something that he shouldn't have.",
    "If you want the truth in the city, and about the abuse the small folk take at the hands of the big folk then you should read 'The Underground'. It sells out of Underhill, but you can pick it up elsewhere too.",
    "That mining magnate, Boleggo Deepdigger, is just getting stranger and stranger as the years go by. I don't think he's been outside of his home in a decade. Shame, all that wealth and he's as barmy as an owlbear from what I hear.",
    "They say that Thilo the Sighted over in the North Wall district is a gifted oracle. Maybe he can't see with his eyes, but I hear that he sees all that goes on.",
    "Andrigor might well be the most powerful Magic User in all of Bard's Gate. Cylyria has certainly benefited from his support. He chooses his apprentices carefully too; they've all turned out well. Wise man, that Andrigor.",
    "There's a Ghost that haunts the Mask and Lute theatre! Frightens the actors, disrupts the plays, nearly dropped a chandelier on some bystanders. Shocking!",
    "The mercenary company, Blackfinger’s Devils, over in Tent City, is always looking for new hires. Denin Blackfinger doesn't throw his soldiers' lives away, which is unusual enough for a mercenary captain, I hear.",
    "Asleif, the Tent City book-seller, is searching for a very special book. She's convinced it's somewhere in Bard's Gate. Her business may not look like much, but I know that she'd pay well for it.",
    "Mama Bobo can see the future. She can look into your soul and know your fate. She even knew where my wedding ring was when I misplaced it in the Hall of Delights.",
    "Fort Rendezvous is a good place for drink and trade in Tent City. Colonel York is a OK type, but Colonel Portland is my kind of man. He's got no time for those filthy half-breed half-orcs or half-elves. He'll still take their coin but nobody's perfect, I say.",
    "Filini in tent city sells the most amazing rugs. They're to die for! You can't throw a party and expect guests to slum it standing on cold marble floors, oh no, dear, that wouldn't do at all! And the colours! Exquisite! Really, I must have some for my next soirée or everyone should think me terribly uncouth.",
    "Keep away from the dirt track and the ponies out by Stable Row. I had a good business before some bad judgement and some bad bets lost it all for me.",
    "If you need armor for your horse, or even your pet dog, then Porsis Gendarme at The Guardian Mount in Stable Row is your woman.",
    "If it's riding horses you need then git on over to Stable Row. They got all kind o' horses. Just don't buy the stolen ones? How'd you know which ones are stolen? How'd the heck would I know?",
    "Something keeps attacking and killing Harold the Herder's animals, over in Stable Row. I'm sure he'd pay a fair price, or some good animals, if someone can put an end to that for him.",
    "My cousin's a Wall Watcher and he had to watch some poor fool be torn apart by some undead abomination out in Hel's Acre. He's a great archer, my cousin. Ended up putting that fool out of his misery with a well aimed arrow. It was a kindness, I'd say.",
    "I heard 7 gate guards tried to help some kid who wandered into Hel's Acre. The kid's dead now, and so are the guards of course.",
"The Caretakers' Guild can help you dispose of unwanted bodies discretely, or even get bodies if that's your kind of thing.",
